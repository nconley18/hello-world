# hello-world
My first repository.

Today is February 6th, 2017 and I am currently a freshman at Penn State working towards a Computer Engineering degree.
I figured a GitHub account would be a good way for me to start coding on my own outside of classwork.
Currently, I am only somewhat experienced in C++ and Python, but I hope to expand my knowledge.
